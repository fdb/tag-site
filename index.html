  <p>
    The applications of artificial intelligence have permeated our society in
    recent years. Consider speech recognition, translation software, fraud
    detection, cancer cell detection, facial recognition and self-driving cars.
    Many of those applications teach the computer to look at the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this research project we want to explore the creative applications of AI
    by gaining insight into the artificial thinking process of the computer. How
    can we, by "deciphering" the algorithms, get a view of "The Algorithmic
    Gaze" - the image that the computer has of the world, and how does this view
    influence our own view of reality? Is it a method that can create a new kind
    of innovative images or styles? Can a computer algorithm guide a creative
    process? And how do we democratize this research by simplifying the complex
    procedures so that they become accessible to a broad group of non-technical
    designers and artists?
