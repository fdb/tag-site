_Assume Calibration Pose: This Breath Isn’t Mine_ is a haptic feedback performance that examines the intersection of sound, movement, and technology. Originating from research presented at Convergence 2024 in Antwerp, this project by _The Algorithmic Gaze_ delves into how AI can act as a mediator in live performance, reshaping interactions between human performers through technology.

The piece features a dancer and an oboist engaged in a unique feedback loop: the dancer’s movements, captured via sensors, are translated into haptic signals delivered to the oboist through a vibrating glove. This link creates an innovative language of communication where each movement generates a musical response, establishing a dynamic exchange between the performers.

Through this exploration, _Assume calibration pose_ sheds light on the transformative power of technology within performance art. By altering bodily awareness and prompting new forms of expression, it invites the audience to reconsider the boundaries between human and machine.

After its debut in Barcelona at the “Dimecres de so i cos” series and its Antwerp presentation at Research Week, the project continues to evolve, seeking ways to enhance this form of interaction.
