_Assume calibration cose: this breath isn’t mine_ is a haptic feedback performance that examines the intersection of sound, movement, and technology. Building on the work presented at Convergence 2024 in Antwerp, this project by The Algorithmic Gaze delves into how AI can mediate live performance by investigating the relationship between performers and technology.

To build this, we designed a custom haptic feedback system that translates the movements of a dancer into vibrations that are felt by a musician. The dancer wears a motion capture suit that tracks her movements, which are then transmitted to the musician through a glove that vibrates in response to the dancer’s motions. This haptic feedback loop creates a unique form of communication between the performers, allowing them to interact in real-time through a shared language of movement and sound.

The piece features two creatures whose movements and behaviours are shaped by the technological systems that guide them. Sensors in the motion capture suit worn by the dancer transmit her movements to the oboist, who responds through a custom-built vibrating glove that translates the dancer’s motions into musical responses. This haptic feedback loop creates an innovative language of communication establishing a dynamic exchange between the performers.

Through this exploration, _Assume calibration pose_ sheds light on probing how technology can create new forms of intimacy and communication between performers, and how it can function as an active collaborator in artistic creation.

After its debut in Barcelona at “Dimecres de so i cos” series and its Antwerp presentation at Research Week, the project continues to evolve, seeking ways to enhance this form of interaction.
