‘Does AI Dream of Gender?’ is an interactive audio-visual installation that explores the topic of gender performativity in digital space. Created using image-to-image translation AI algorithms, this project is a visual research and study of how AI understands the idea of gender, based simply on open-source photo databases taken from the internet.

The main inspirations behind this project are ideas of post- and trans- humanism as proposed by Donna Hawaray in her infamous ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’ essay and Jaques Lacan’s concept of the ‘mirror stage'. When does one understand, see, and form its gender? How do the images surrounding us in virtual and physical worlds form our understanding of gender and the image after which we create our own gender(s)? The goal of this installation is not to answer those questions but pose them and many others to the viewer.
