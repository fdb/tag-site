**Polaroid Memories** was based on found footage of incorrectly developed Polaroid images. The amount of images was quite low; we were able to augment the footage using our augmentation tools (flip horizontal/vertical, random contrast and brightness differences).
The work was presented as a collection of images and a movie of the training process.
