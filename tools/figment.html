<p>
    Using machine learning for students can still be daunting. In recent years,
    the situation has been improved by libraries such as ml5.js, which make
    machine learning available to anyone with a basic knowledge of coding. But
    linking all these different components together is still a lot of work.

<p>
    The goal of Figment is to be the easiest tool to start using AI for creative
    purposes. After you download and run the tool, you can set up a simple drawing
    application that uses your body with a few clicks. The basic methodology is
    that of visual coding, which we also used in the NodeBox project based on
    previous research.

    Figment was used in a one-day pre-master class in March 2020 with 10 students.
    Within a few hours, students, some with no prior programming skills, were able
    to create projects that used machine learning to do pose detection, collage
    generation and more.
