<p>
  One of the most interesting models in the field of generative AI are GANs or
  Generative Adversarial Networks. This is a complex ensemble of 2 models that
  fight with each other, each improving in the process and creating new images,
  text or sound.
</p>

<p>
  The mechanisms for GANs are complex and often not intuitive. Training GANs
  requires powerful machines that normal users do not have access to. In
  addition, they require coding and installation procedures that can be
  daunting.
</p>

<p>
  To overcome these barriers, we developed GANDelve, an experimental tool for
  training Generative Adversarial Networks from scratch. The tool runs locally
  on users' computers, but uses Google's Cloud AI offerings to perform the
  actual training on fast GPUs hosted in Google's data centers.
</p>

<p>
  GANDelve was introduced during LAbO 2019, ChampdAction's summer school that
  took place in late August 2019. We also had premaster and master students use
  the tool to train their own machine learning models.
