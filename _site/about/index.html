  <main><section><h1>The Algorithmic Gaze</h1>
<p>The applications of artificial intelligence have permeated our society in recent years. Consider speech recognition, translation software, fraud detection, cancer cell detection, facial recognition and self-driving cars. Many of those applications teach the computer to look at the world.</p>
<p>In this research project we want to explore the creative applications of AI by gaining insight into the artificial thinking process of the computer. How can we, by &quot;deciphering&quot; the algorithms, get a view of &quot;The Algorithmic Gaze&quot; - the image that the computer has of the world, and how does this view influence our own view of reality? Is it a method that can create a new kind of innovative images or styles? Can a computer algorithm guide a creative process? And how do we democratize this research by simplifying the complex procedures so that they become accessible to a broad group of non-technical designers and artists?</p>
<h1>The Domain of AI</h1>
<p>Within the arts, the innovative use of new media and technology is a constant. Andy Warhol used industrial processes to produce his art, Bruce Nauman used neon as his canvas, Alvin Lucier used audio feedback as a central concept in his work &quot;I Am Sitting in a Room,&quot; and closer to home the experimental theater lab Crew uses technology and immersion to demonstrate the extent to which it changes people and society.</p>
<p>Computers that can be creative themselves can be found, for example, in the work of the late Harold Cohen. He created AARON in collaboration with Kurzweil CyberArt Technologies, a computer program that creates paintings autonomously [McCorduck, 1991]. The work of Pindar Van Arman [Van Arman, 2017] and Aican [Elgammal, 2017] build on that pioneering work, adding procedures from artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Central to this process are algorithms: code written by programmers that determine exactly when the computer takes certain actions. With the introduction of machine learning, the task of programming shifts from the programmer to the machine. Unlike in the past, computers acquire knowledge independently based on a huge amount of data. With the introduction of deep learning, made possible by faster machines, tasks such as image recognition suddenly became possible, something that until a few years ago was considered unfeasible for computers. Applications exist in medical science, self-driving cars, chatbots and profiling, and so also in the arts. Google's Deep Dream algorithm was a first major contribution in the use of deep learning for creating new images. In it, image recognition algorithms were reversed to make clear what the computer was &quot;thinking&quot; about. This creates a series of images that represent what the computer's thought process is [Mordvintsev, 2015] [Figure 1]. Newer techniques rely on GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks [Goodfellow, 2014] [Elgammal, 2017]. This is a machine learning algorithm based on a set of two neural networks: one side can be compared to an art forger, the other to an art critic trying to detect forgeries. Because they learn from each other, both sides become stronger, and the works are unique. All these new possibilities also raise many questions. What exactly does an AI algorithm see? With what &quot;gaze&quot; does the computer look at our world? What is the guiding logic and how does it find a solution through technology? Can it encourage creative processes through its unique gaze? Will AI then eventually replace the designer or artist? Is AI art, because of its technical complexity, only something that will be accessible to the &quot;happy few&quot;?</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>The goal of this research is to make <strong>artistic creation via artificial intelligence available to artists and designers</strong>. For this, we first want to <strong>gain insight</strong> into the artificial looking of the machine and the artistic potential of current tools. Then we will develop <strong>new user-friendly software</strong> to link to existing creative processes. We <strong>share the available knowledge</strong> through lectures, workshops, freely available (open source) software and online documentation.</p>
