# The Algorithmic Gaze

The applications of artificial intelligence are everywhere: just think of image recognition, recommendation algorithms, voice and face recognition algorithms, ... In the arts, AI also leads to interesting results, however often by using powerful hardware or existing datasets, and thus beyond the reach or control of most artists.

Our mission is to bring AI into the artist's practice by developing open-source tools and methodologies
that make the domain more accessible and transparent. Our research asks how AI can become a trusted partner in the
creative process, both during creation and execution. We explore how AI understands the materiality of body, space
and time. Our approach avoids megalomanic datasets; instead we focus on carefully self-assembled datasets and an
intuitive visual understanding of algorithms to avoid the bias inherent in large-scale models and take ownership of
our own "small AI."

# Goals

The goal of this research is to make **artistic creation via artificial intelligence available to artists and designers**. For this, we:

- Develop **new user-friendly software** to link to existing creative processes,
- Initiate **artistic collaborations** with artists and designers to help them use our tools and methods,
- **Share available knowledge** through lectures, papers, workshops, freely available (open source) software and online documentation.
