We organise intensive machine learning workshops for students from [Sint Lucas Antwerpen](https://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/en/sintlucasantwerpen/) and [LUCA school of arts](https://www.luca-arts.be/en). In these workshops we introduce students to the practice of machine learning, explaining the basic concepts and using our software to gather, prepare, train and visualise images or sounds. Topics are in a variety of fields.

Students have been training on passerby data to create a models that synthesises them, on vegetables to create a vegetable shader, as a style transfer experiment, on Kaggle datasets like Pokemons...
