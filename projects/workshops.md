We organise workshops for our students and try to make them familiair with our software as a tool to create a dataset to train a model. Topics are in a variety of fields.

Students have been training on passerby data to create a models that synthesises them, on vegetables to create a vegetable shader, on sets on kaggle like pokemons..
