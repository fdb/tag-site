This research explores the intersection of AI and performance art by developing human-scale, trustworthy AI systems that enable artists to engage in creative interactions with machines. These AI systems are designed to be adapted during working sessions, allowing for rapid iterations and real-time adjustments.

Using these AI systems we aim to develop an open method of performative explorations. Through these explorations we create sensory and conceptual translations that present a dialogue between body and machine. The project will result in a series of performances and open-source tools that showcase the potential of AI in artistic contexts, fostering a collaborative and improvisational relationship between human performers and intelligent machines.

We're developing custom hardware and software to drive our "motion to pulse" setup, integrating it with our existing [Figment](https://figmentapp.com/) software platform.
