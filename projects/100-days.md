Joud Toamah is a Syrian designer based in Belgium. Her visual research on the acts of remembrance and forgetfulness emerging from repetitive interactions resulted in drawing an image from memory every day, for a period of 100 days.

After drawing these images she designed a system for destroying these images through analog and digital manipulations such as cutting, folding and blurring the images.

She experimented with [GANdelve](/tools/gandelve) to "restore" the original image after its destruction. She used both the 100 hand-drawn original images and the 100 destroyed images to train different models. The result is a collection of 5 movies of images being reconstructed, deconstructed and explored.
