The AI dancer was created during the LAbO 2021 summer school as part of the "Cyber Sensuality" project. After training AI (Artificial Intelligence) on different gendered bodies and private intuitive acts, it eventually responded with its own forms of virtual sensuality through gesture, movement and sound. Out of this training emerged a gender-fluid avatar.

This begs not only the question of power and understanding of ‘erotic’ movement inside an algorithm, but also how eroticism is gendered. Can the AI perceive subtle signs of arousal to understand our displays of embodiment? Suggestive glimpses and subconscious human desires are translated into the virtual world.

During the performance we show and interact with the AI’s interpretation of the erotic, resulting in a flirtatious conversation with artificial intelligence.
